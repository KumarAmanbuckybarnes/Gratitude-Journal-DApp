# Gratitude Journal DApp

This is a simple decentralized application (DApp) built using **Solidity** and **Web3.js** that allows users to record and view their gratitude entries on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Record Gratitude**: Users can write and submit gratitude entries to the Ethereum blockchain.
- **View Gratitude**: Users can retrieve and display all gratitude entries they've made using their wallet address.
- **Decentralized**: All gratitude entries are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that the data is secure, immutable, and transparent.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, make sure you have the following:

1. **MetaMask** or another Web3-compatible wallet installed in your browser.
2. An Ethereum testnet or mainnet (such as Rinkeby, Goerli, or mainnet) to deploy the smart contract.
3. A text editor like **VS Code** to modify and deploy the contract.
4. **Web3.js** to interact with the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract

1. **Compile the Solidity contract**:
   - You can use **Remix IDE** (https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile and deploy the contract.
2. **Deploy the contract**:

   - Deploy the `GratitudeJournal` contract to a testnet or the mainnet.
   - Once deployed, you'll get a **contract address** and **ABI** that you need for the frontend.

3. **Save the contract address and ABI**:
   - You will use the contract address and ABI to connect the frontend to your deployed contract.

### 2. Set Up the Frontend

1. **Clone or download the repository**:

   - Clone the repository or create a new directory to store your frontend files.

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd gratitude-journal
   ```

2. **Modify the `index.html` file**:

   - Open the `index.html` file and replace the following placeholders:

     - **`YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`**: Replace this with the actual contract address you received after deploying the contract.

     - **Contract ABI**: Ensure the ABI (Application Binary Interface) is correct. The ABI is a JSON array that defines the functions and events in your smart contract. You can get it from the Remix IDE after compiling your contract.

     Example:

     ```javascript
     const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; // Replace with your deployed contract address
     const contractABI = [
         // Replace with the ABI of your compiled contract
         ...
     ];
     ```

3. **Open the `index.html` in a browser**:
   - Make sure **MetaMask** (or your preferred Web3 wallet) is installed and connected to the network where your contract is deployed.
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (Google Chrome or Firefox recommended).

### 3. Using the Application

1. **Connect your wallet**:

   - Click the **Connect Wallet** button. MetaMask (or another Web3 wallet) will ask you to approve the connection. After connecting, your wallet address will be displayed on the page.

2. **Record Gratitude**:

   - In the "Record Gratitude" section, type your gratitude entry into the textarea and click **Record Gratitude**. This will send a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain to store your gratitude entry.

3. **View Your Entries**:
   - After recording entries, you can click **Get My Entries** to retrieve and display all your gratitude entries associated with your connected wallet address. The entries will be displayed with the timestamp.

### 4. Web3 Wallet Integration

The application is designed to interact with Web3-compatible wallets like **MetaMask**. If you don't have MetaMask installed, you'll be prompted to install it when you attempt to connect your wallet.

### 5. Deployment on a Live Network

To deploy this application on the Ethereum mainnet or a testnet:

1. **Host the frontend**:

   - You can host the frontend using any static website hosting platform, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

2. **Use a proper Ethereum provider**:
   - If you're using a public testnet like **Rinkeby** or **Goerli**, ensure you set up a provider URL via **Infura** or **Alchemy**.
   - Replace the default Web3 provider in the frontend code if you're using a custom provider.

## Contract Code (GratitudeJournal.sol)

Here is the Solidity code for the `GratitudeJournal` contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GratitudeJournal {
    // Struct to store a gratitude entry
    struct GratitudeEntry {
        address author;
        string entry;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    // Array to store all gratitude entries
    GratitudeEntry[] public entries;

    // Event to log when a new gratitude entry is added
    event GratitudeRecorded(address indexed author, string entry, uint256 timestamp);

    // Function to add a new gratitude entry
    function recordGratitude(string memory _entry) public {
        // Ensure the entry is not empty
        require(bytes(_entry).length > 0, "Gratitude entry cannot be empty");

        // Create a new entry and add it to the entries array
        GratitudeEntry memory newEntry = GratitudeEntry({
            author: msg.sender,
            entry: _entry,
            timestamp: block.timestamp
        });

        entries.push(newEntry);

        // Emit an event to log the new entry
        emit GratitudeRecorded(msg.sender, _entry, block.timestamp);
    }

    // Function to retrieve all gratitude entries for a specific address
    function getEntriesByAuthor(address _author) public view returns (GratitudeEntry[] memory) {
        // Create a dynamic array to store matching entries
        GratitudeEntry[] memory authorEntries = new GratitudeEntry[](entries.length);
        uint256 count = 0;

        // Iterate through all entries to find matches
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < entries.length; i++) {
            if (entries[i].author == _author) {
                authorEntries[count] = entries[i];
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Create a new array with exact size to return
        GratitudeEntry[] memory result = new GratitudeEntry[](count);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            result[i] = authorEntries[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **MetaMask connection issues**: Ensure your MetaMask is connected to the correct network (the same one as your contract).
- **Transaction failed**: Ensure you have enough gas in your wallet to send transactions.
- **Entries not displaying**: Make sure the Ethereum network is synced and the contract address/ABI is correctly set in the frontend.
